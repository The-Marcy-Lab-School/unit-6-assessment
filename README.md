# Fetch and Async Assessment

### Directions

**For Short Responses:**

1. Navigate to the `short-responses` folder. Write your responses directly in the `short-response.md` file. **Be sure to format your responses and code snippets correctly using Markdown.** As you commit and push changes, you will see your rendered markdown on GitHub.

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. Navigate to the `coding-exercises` folder to complete the coding exercises.
2. There are several features to implement.
3. Skeleton HTML file (`index.html`), a JavaScript file (`app.js`), and a pre-filled styling sheet (`styles.css`) have been created for you. It is your job to write code that meets the problem requirements listed in the `README.md`


When you are done with both sections. Push your final commits and submit through Canvas.

### Tips

- This is open book, open note, open documentation, open console. Use your resources. Just don't use your neighbor. ðŸ˜‰
- Pay close attention to your spelling and grammar. For short responses, if you want to take advantage of spell check, etc., you can always type in a word document first and then copy your responses over.
- I'm looking for clarity and conciseness. Answer the questions as directly as you possibly can, in as few words as you possibly can, while using as precise of language as you possibly can.
